                <h1>Dune by Frank Herbert</h1>
                <p>Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.</p>

                <h1>The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien </h1>
                <p>Hobbits, a race of small humanlike creatures, characteristically value peace, simplicity, and cozy homes yet are capable of incredible feats of courage and resourcefulness. The unwilling hero of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is persuaded by the wizard Gandalf to leave his village, Hobbiton, and join Thorin and his 12 dwarfs to recover their stolen treasure, which is being guarded by the dragon Smaug. During the expedition, Bilbo finds a magical ring that renders the wearer invisible, which figures prominently in The Lord of the Rings, a novel originally published in three parts that followed in 1954−55. When Bilbo and Gandalf return to Hobbiton, Bilbo is no longer accepted, his adventurous behavior being deemed unhobbitlike. The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo’s maturing from a seeker of warmth and comforts to a fighter, however humble, for the greater good. He proves to be an unlikely hero who achieves metamorphosis through pools of inner strength he did not know he possessed.</p>
